      Hello! My name is <span class = "name"> Luan Nguyen </span>. I'm a 4th year Computer Science Major who
      has been stuck at home like a lot of y'all these past months. In my free
      time I like to dance, trick, and find new places for good food and drink.
      That's been a little hard to do in these times, but I do my best to keep
      up with these activites inside.

      I end up watching a lot of Netflix instead.
      I've been watching <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> and if you haven't watched
      <em>After Life </em>, it's really good. Sad and funny. Quarantine life also
      has led me to watch several animes and play more SSBM (rollback hype, I'm terrible
      though). I'm hoping that I can go meet my friends and return to a more normal
      lifestyle soon, but seems like that might be a while.<strong>Stay healthy and do your part
      to keep everyone safe!!</strong>
