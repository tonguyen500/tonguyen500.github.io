      <p>Dancing is one of my passions. I'm part of a collegiate level dance team
      called Level V Origins. We're open to beginners in dance (I came with almost
      no experience!) with no auditions. This year is going to be a bit weird with
      COVID, but check us out online if you're interested. Our last performance
      is linked! I'm just playing around with href. </p>

      <p>Tricking is a combination of martial arts, flips, breakdance, capoeira,
      gymnastics and a lot more disciplines of movement and expression. It's hard
      to put into words, so click on the image for a video to explain.   </p>
