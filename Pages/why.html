    <p>
      I'm looking to complete both Front End and Back End by the end of the
      school year and am interested in pursuing web development as a career.
      I have experience in C++, Python, and a bit of HTML, CSS from a Udemy bootcamp
      I started but stopped when this class started. Hoping to get enough
      experience and land a related internship in the near future.
